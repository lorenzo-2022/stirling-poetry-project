Scotland is a place with lots of squirrels
Stirling is a town with nuts

majestic Forth flowing wide,
nature's artistry, a scenic guide.
mists that dance on Dumyat glen,
whispers of tales from way back when.

bagpipes hum, a haunting tune,
underneath the knowledge moon.
lawn blooms in greenish hue,
uni spirits, strong and true.
